# Java Learning Projects

This repository contains my small practice projects created while learning Java and backend development.

These projects focus on:

- File handling (read/write)
- CRUD operations
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interfaces and abstractions
- Enums and Date handling
- Basic business logic
- Console-based applications

Purpose:
To improve my programming skills and gain hands-on experience with core Java concepts through real mini-projects.

Each folder contains a separate project, focusing on different aspects of Java development.

This repository is actively maintained and updated during my learning process.
