# Java Learning Projects

This repository contains small practice projects created while learning Java.

The goal of these projects is to build strong foundations in backend development
and prepare for junior developer positions.

## Topics covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling (read/write)
- CRUD operations
- Interfaces and abstractions
- Enums (used in some projects)
- Date handling (LocalDate)
- Collections (List, ArrayList)
- Basic business logic
- Console applications

## Structure

Each folder contains a separate mini project.
Some projects focus on CRUD systems, others on task management,
statistics, or business logic.

More details can be found in each project’s folder.
